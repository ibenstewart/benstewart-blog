# Ben Stewart

I [build things](/bio) and help teams build better.

I'm currently at [Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.net), working on how technology, product, and people come together to make travel simpler. Lately that means a lot of AI, platforms, and figuring out how teams actually ship fast without losing their minds.

I’ve spent years leading engineering teams; turning fuzzy strategy into real systems.

I write and think about delivery, product strategy, leadership, and culture.
