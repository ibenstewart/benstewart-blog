# The Truth About Authentic Leadership

In a world where jargon often drowns out the human voice, authentic leadership should shine — guiding, inspiring, and sometimes warning. But WTF does it mean to be an "authentic leader"? Are we talking about being your jammy-wearing, Netflix-binging self in all team meetings? Not quite, but also, not far off.

## Peeling Off the Corporate Mask

First off, authentic leadership isn't about revealing your wildest weekend plans or oversharing to the point of making the People Team nervous. It's about ditching the robotic, cookie-cutter mould that's been passed down from one corporate generation to another. We all have our stereotypes of what this could be, for me—stiff suits, stiffer expressions, and motivational posters that make you roll your eyes so hard you see your brain.

Being authentic means being **real**. It's showing up as the person you are outside the office while maintaining professionalism. It's about integrating your values, beliefs, and personality into your style. This doesn't mean turning every team meeting into a therapy session.

<KeyPoint>It means leading with empathy, transparency, and sometimes vulnerability.</KeyPoint>

## The Secret Sauce

Vulnerability is a word that many in leadership circles avoid like the plague. It's seen as a weakness, a dent in corporate armour. However, in my opinion, vulnerability is the secret sauce of authentic leadership. It's what transforms a manager into a leader and makes someone worth following.

Admitting you don't have all the answers, sharing your failures and fears, and asking for help doesn't make you weak; it makes you accessible. It breaks down the barrier between "us" and "them" and fosters a culture of trust and open communication. When leaders are vulnerable, they permit others to be the same. This is where innovation, creativity, and genuine team spirit start to flourish.

## Empathy

Empathy in leadership is often talked about but rarely practised. It's not just nodding while someone speaks; it's actively putting yourself in their shoes, understanding their perspective, and responding accordingly. Empathy is what turns a group of individuals into a cohesive team.

An empathetic leader recognizes the challenges their team faces, both in and out of the workplace. They understand that life doesn't pause at the office door. By acknowledging the human side of their team, authentic leaders create a supportive environment where everyone feels valued and understood.

## Transparency

Transparency is another pillar of authentic leadership for me. This doesn't mean airing out the company's dirty laundry or sharing confidential information in the name of openness. It means being honest about what's happening within the company, good or bad.

When leaders are transparent, they demystify the decision-making process. They explain the "why" behind actions, which helps to align the team's efforts with the company's goals. Transparency eliminates rumours, gossip, lies and builds trust. It's about treating your team as stakeholders who deserve to know the state of play.

So, why bother being an authentic leader? Because authenticity wins—every fucking time. Authentic leaders will spark loyalty, drive engagement, and attract talent. People want to work for someone real, someone they can relate to and trust.

An authentic leadership style also promotes mental health and well-being within the team. It creates a safe space for individuals to express themselves, challenge ideas, and grow. This not only boosts morale but also leads to better decision-making and more innovative solutions.

## Being an Authentic Leader Every Day

Being an authentic leader isn't something you can fake, for long. Here are a few ways that I've tried to be authentic in the past:

- **Share my journey.** Talk about challenges, the lessons learned, the fact I didn't know what I was doing half the time, and the obstacles overcome. This makes you more relatable.
- **Listen more than you speak.** Embrace awkward silences to make sure teams don't expect you to talk about everything.
- **Be decisive but flexible.** Stand firm on values and decisions but be open to feedback and willing to adjust when necessary.
- **Encourage authenticity in others.** Create an environment where everyone feels comfortable being themselves.
- **Practice what you preach.** Your actions should align with your words. Consistency is key to building trust and credibility.

## Closing Thoughts

Writing all of the above, self-reflecting, I'm wondering how often I'm failing my own advice given; but that's part of the story. This isn't a smooth journey, you will fuck up and break things. However, it's a path filled with genuine humans, real growth, and the kind of success that feels damn good because it's rooted in truth.

<TLDR>So, let's strip away the bullshit and lead like humans, for humans.</TLDR>
